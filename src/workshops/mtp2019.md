Thank you to everybody who attended. Y'all were excellent.

You can [download the slides on DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m4t8iwxhtixfx0t/user-story-mapping-mtpcon2019.pdf?dl=0). Some other references you might find useful:

* If you want to learn more about User Story Mapping I recommend reading the book [User Story Mapping by Jeff Patton](https://amzn.to/2Nf7yh5).
* Jeff also has some other excellent [user story mapping references on his website](https://www.jpattonassociates.com/user-story-mapping/).
* You may find Jeff's [user story mapping quick reference](https://www.jpattonassociates.com/story-mapping-quick-ref/) especially useful.
* There's a separate [write up of the bin-thin-split value based questions](https://medium.com/quietstars/user-stories-bin-thin-or-split-ac4859ad1b5c) over on [Medium](https://medium.com/quietstars).
* I talked to a couple of groups about the [Kano Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model) as a tool to help show the value of iterating & improving on features. Those folk might find [this article by Jared Spool](https://articles.uie.com/kano_model/) of interest.
* I also touched upon the larger problem of relating the larger scale organisational vision/strategy to the customer journeys represented in user story maps. There are some bonus slides at the end of the deck on dropbox that have some pointers to [OKRs](http://eleganthack.com/the-art-of-the-okr/), [Opportunity-Solution Trees](https://www.producttalk.org/2016/08/opportunity-solution-tree/), [Impact Maps](https://www.impactmapping.org), and [Wardley Maps](https://medium.com/wardleymaps) — which are all useful approaches to explore to help in that area at different levels of abstraction.
