Hi. How are you? I hope you're having a good day.

If you want to know why this site exists go read [Can you do a shitty first draft?](/posts/can-you-do-a-shitty-first-draft/)

I started off as a developer last century, wandered aimlessly into product & UX work, got into agile real heavy, and have turned into a ghastly consultant in my old age. I'm at my best solving problems where Product, Agile, and UX overlap. I also vacillate between Impostor Syndrome & the Dunning-Kruger effect on an almost hourly basis.  These days I mostly do coaching, workshops, training, and the odd talk. If you want to talk to me about work stuff go visit [quietstars.com](http://quietstars.com).

I'm slightly deaf and _really_ bad with faces and names. So when I blank you in real life I'm not trying to be offensive. I do it to everybody. Sorry.

If you want to get in touch email ([adrianh@quietstars.com](mailto:adrianh@quietstars.com)), twitter ([@adrianh](https://twitter.com/adrianh)), and LinkedIn ([linkedin.com/in/adrianh/](http://linkedin.com/in/adrianh/)) all work.

ttfn.
