This isn't rocket science — but it is apparently something that still needs to be said.

Putting requirements in your job advert that the job doesn't absolutely require **gets you a less qualified pool of applicants**.

It's that simple.

The unqualified bullshit artists will still apply. Because they and their dumb-ass egos don't care or understand that they're unqualified.

The mythical perfect candidate who actually has all of your kinda-would-be-nice-to-have "requirements" will probably still apply — because **they still meet your actual requirements**.

Then again they may just run away — because your random shopping list of requirements has demonstrated that you don't actually understand what the role **needs** in the job advert.

The **only** people a long list of requirements filters out are people who think you're telling the truth and really need somebody who ticks every item on your list.

Every unnecessary requirement on a job advert is **literally** making your pool of qualified candidates smaller.

Is fewer qualified candidates your goal? No? Then stop doing this. 

Please.

Finally — as FJ points out

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It also *strongly* narrows the diversity of who will apply.</p>&mdash; FJ (@fj) <a href="https://twitter.com/fj/status/1283347381363384320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote>

For example, see Tara Sophia Mohr's article on [Why Women Don’t Apply for Jobs Unless They’re 100% Qualified](https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified). 

If you fix your job advert you can make this whole class of problem vanish. Without forcing job applicants to change their behaviour to cope with a long list of unnecessary job requirements.

Rant over.

ttfn.
