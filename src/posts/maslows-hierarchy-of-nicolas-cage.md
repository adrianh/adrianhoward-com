Inspired by David Bland's [Nicolas Cage based explanation of Cynefin](https://twitter.com/davidjbland/status/667083621065322496) I wasted 30m last night coming up with the equivalent for [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs).

Yes. I'm aware there are lots of issues with Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. This is a joke :-)
